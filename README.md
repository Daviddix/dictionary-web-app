## Overview
This is a simple dictionary webapp app that gets the definition, phonetic, pronunciation and part(s) of speech of a given word. The data is gotten from Free Dictionary API.

The app fetches the data of a given word from the API and inputs it in the states which is then passed as an input to the JSX.

The web app was made with ReactJS and Vanilla CSS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Search for a given word
See:
- Definition(s) for the given word
- phonetic for the given word
- Listen to the pronunciation for the given word
- Part(s) of speech for the given word
- Link for external definition for the given word

## My process
I started by designing the webapp with invision studio then I went ahead and created a skeleton of the app with JSX, I then added CSS for styling the app. I added functionality with React(JavaScript); fetching data from the API, inputting data into the JSX, e.t.c. 

### Built with
